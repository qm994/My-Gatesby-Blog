### Welcome!

Thank you everyone who clicked here about my personal blog! I would like to take a few minutes to introduce my self. My name is Qingyuan Ma and I am currently a data engineer in a Financial Tech firm. This is very interesting because I was majored in bioinformatics in my bachelor and master but after I graduation, I just decided to transfer my technology, which I hold a lot passion on it! For my future career plan: I am planning to be a full stack engineer and one of reason is I love the process of building applications from beginning to the end and enjoy it a lot!

In the workspace, I have done something like dashboards development, devops(docker, gcp, CI/CD etc), tests, data analysis, data visualizatiion etc. 

In my spare time, I have built:
> 1. python django application for a real estate site which help the realtors to track the properties and communicate with the buyers! 

> 2. ecommerce application which integrated with React.js, Redux, Firebase, Stripe(for payment process) and helpe the consumers to buy products.

> 3. An Node.js and react.js application which can be used to connect different developers;

So if you have any good ideas about the full stack projects and want to cooporate with me, please feel free to reach out!
